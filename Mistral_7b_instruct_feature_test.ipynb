OpenAI tends to present its products as productivity tools, simple utilities for getting things done. On the other hand, Meta is in the entertainment business and is building LLMs for its messaging apps. OpenAI's ChatGPT, the large language model, has a voice feature that is currently only available to ChatGPT Plus subscribers, but free users will have access to it in the future. This feature is a big step for AI, as it gives the model a hint of personality. In contrast, Meta has unveiled 28 personality-driven chatbots to be used in its messaging apps, which are inspired by real-life celebrities. While these chatbots may have some novelty value, it remains to be seen how much time users will spend interacting with them. Additionally, Meta is planning to place its AI characters on every major surface of its products, including Facebook pages, Instagram accounts, and Reels. This could fundamentally change the way we think about social networking."
